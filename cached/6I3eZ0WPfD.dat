Graduate Admissions and Scholarship   Standards</strong> &nbsp; </p>          <blockquote><A name="IA"></a><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admissions Requirements</strong> &nbsp;</blockquote>          <blockquote>            <blockquote>Admission to the Graduate School is open to qualified graduates of   universities and colleges of recognized standing without regard to age, race,   color, sex, religion, national origin, or disability. Admission to the Graduate   School is a selective process intended to identify those applicants who are   outstanding among recipients of baccalaureate degrees. Because of the large and   increasing number of applications, not all qualified applicants can be admitted;   satisfying the minimum requirements below does not guarantee   admission.</blockquote>            <blockquote>The following minimum qualifications are required of all students   seeking a masters degree:              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) The applicant must have a baccalaureate degree from an educational   institution of recognized standing. Under special circumstances, students who   have less than 12 semester credits to complete for the baccalaureate degree are   permitted to apply to the Graduate School and to take courses for graduate   credit. </p>              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The applicant must show, by a combination of educational background,   academic performance, and work experience, the potential to succeed in advanced   study and research in computer science. Minimum preparation usually includes the   ability to program in one or more common high-level languages (preferably Java,   C++, C, Modula-2, or Pascal), at least one semester of calculus, and experience   in using simple data structures such as linked lists and binary trees.   Unconditional admission to the masters program normally requires courses in   computer science principles and theory equivalent to the NDSU courses CS 160, CS   161, CS 222 or CS 235, CS 372, and CS 373. </p>              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The applicant at the baccalaureate level must have earned a   cumulative grade point average in all courses of at least 3.0 out of 4.0 or   equivalent to attain full standing in a graduate degree program. Students with a   previous graduate degree with a GPA of 3.25 or equivalent may be admitted in   full standing. </p>              <p>The application process starts with a student getting an application form   from the Graduate Studies Office of NDSU. The student must complete the entire   application and submit it along with the indicated fee (currently $20 in United   States dollars) to the Graduate Studies Office. The applicant must arrange for   all institutions previously attended to send official transcripts of all his or   her work to the Graduate Studies Office. Three letters of recommendation must be   submitted as well. An application will not be considered until all of these   materials have been received. </p>              <p>Once the application and supporting materials have arrived, the Graduate   Studies Office will send them to the Computer Science Department for evaluation.   The departmental admissions committee develops a recommendation for each   application. The recommendation is returned to the Graduate Studies Office,   which makes the final decision and informs the applicant. The entire process   generally takes two to four weeks. Applicants concerned about the status of   their application should contact the Graduate Studies Office at (701) 237-7033,   rather than contacting the department directly.</p>            </blockquote>            <A name="IB"></a><strong>B. Admission Status</strong>            <p>Graduate Students will be admitted under one of the following   classifications: </p>            <p><U>Full Graduate Standing</U>: These students have met the requirements for   admission and have been accepted by the Department and the Graduate School. A   student must have full graduate standing to receive a graduate degree. </p>            <p><U>Conditional Status</U>: These students do not meet all requirements for   admission or have deficiencies in prerequisite course work but show potential   for successful graduate study. Evidence must be provided showing that the   applicant's potential is not adequately reflected by his/her record. In Computer   Science, a minimum grade point average of 2.7 on a 4.0 scale (B-) is required as   well as at least 2 quantitative classes. Students with a lower average and at   least 3 years of computing-related job experience may be considered for   conditional status. </p>            <p>Students admitted conditionally may, in consultation with the major advisor,   request a change to full graduate standing after the conditions of admission   have been satisfied. This request is made to the dean of the graduate school by   the major advisor when approved by the department chair. </p>            <p>Conditions attached to a student's admission are viewed very seriously by the   department, and the student should give a high priority to satisfying these   conditions as soon as possible. In particular, students whose status is   conditional are subject to the following restrictions: 1) they are normally not   considered for assistantships; 2) they may not earn more than a total of twelve   semester hours of graduate credit; 3) they may not file a Plan of Study; and 4)   they may not take the department's Comprehensive Examination. (In some   circumstances, this last restriction may be relaxed to the extent that a student   enrolled in courses whose completion will satisfy the conditions may take the   exam in that same semester.) </p>            <p><U>Non-degree Enrollment</U>: These students are in a post-baccalaureate but   non-degree enrollment status. Students must have prerequisite courses or   background/experience necessary for the course or courses in which they desire   to enroll. This may require consultation and approval by the course instructor.   In courses with limited enrollment, preference will be given to degree-seeking   students. Students enrolled in the non-degree status are not eligible for   graduate assistantships or tuition waivers. </p>            <p>There are two categories of non-degree students: <U>Unclassified</U> and <U>Provisional</U>. </p>            <p><U>Unclassified</U> students are those holding a baccalaureate degree from an   institution of recognized standing who are pursuing studies beyond the   baccalaureate degree for personal growth and improvement of skills but are not   working toward an advanced degree. Submission of course transcripts, letters of   recommendation, and scores on special examinations are required only when   specifically requested. </p>            <p>Students who do not meet the requirements for admission may under special   conditions be admitted under a <U>provisional</U> status. Students enrolled   under the provisional status will be assigned a faculty advisor by the graduate   dean upon recommendation of the department chair. These students must take a   minimum of six but not more than nine semester hours of graduate credit, with no   grade less than B, before a change may be requested. </p>            <p>Students enrolled in the non-degree status may request admission to a degree   program by submitting a complete application to the Graduate School. Appropriate   course credits earned in the non-degree status may be used to fulfill graduate   degree requirements only if approved by the student's program committee and the   dean of the Graduate School. Unless otherwise specified, no more than one-third   of the course work applied toward a graduate degree may be taken in the   non-degree status. No course taken in the non-degree status in which a grade of   less than "B" has been earned will be permitted on a plan of study for an   advanced degree. </p>            <p><A name="IC"></a><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission of International Students</strong> </p>            <p>North Dakota State University welcomes international students as part of the   student body, and the Graduate School encourages applications from qualified   students throughout the world. </p>            <p>Applications are forwarded by the Graduate School to the Director of   International Programs for confirmation of compliance with immigration   regulations, financial requirements, etc. Even though an applicant may be   academically acceptable to a department and the Graduate School, the Director of   International Programs may refuse admission if the applicant cannot meet that   office's requirements. </p>            <p>In order to have adequate time to properly process the financial statements   and other documents necessary for obtaining visas for international students not   currently in the United States, the Office of International Programs has   established the following deadlines for application to the graduate school: </p>            <blockquote>For admission in the <strong><U>fall</U></strong> semester,&nbsp; <strong><U>April   1</U></strong> <BR />              For admission in the <U><strong>spring</strong> </U>semester, <strong><U>August   1</U></strong></blockquote>            These dates are recommended deadlines.&nbsp; It may still be   possible for international students whose applications are completed after these   dates to obtain admission for the next semester; however, the department   strongly recommends that the application be substantially completed by these   dates or as shortly thereafter as possible.            <p>In addition to meeting the previously stated admission requirements, to   qualify for admission in an advanced degree program, all international students   must demonstrate proficiency in English and must provide evidence of adequate   financial support for the duration of the graduate program. </p>            <p>English proficiency must be demonstrated prior to admission by a satisfactory   score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The computer science   department considers a satisfactory score to be 550 or higher. Information about   this test is available from Educational Testing Service, Box 955, Princeton, NJ   08540. In special instances, English proficiency may be demonstrated by   attaining a score of 85 or higher on the Michigan Test of English Language   Proficiency (MTELP) administered only at North Dakota State University and   followed by a personal interview. This requirement may be waived for most   students from countries where English is the official language and for students   who have earned a degree from a U.S. university or college. </p>            <p>Under certain circumstances, applications from students not able to   demonstrate the minimum level of proficiency in the English language may be   accepted conditionally, but English proficiency at the required level must be   demonstrated prior to attainment of full standing in a graduate degree program.   North Dakota State University offers a five-week intensive English program   during the summer designed to raise the English proficiency of students who have   scored at least 500 on the TOEFL and are otherwise academically acceptable. </p>            <p>Once documentation of the required level of English proficiency has been   received by the Graduate School, and all other admission requirements are met,   the student may be admitted to the graduate degree program. </p>            <p>Evidence of adequate financial resources for self-support (e.g., tuition,   living costs, and transportation) during the entire graduate program is required   of each international student. Detailed information on estimated annual expenses   for international students is available from the Office of International   Programs. <strong>Students should not assume funds or work opportunities will be   available at a later date</strong>. </p>            <p>An international student must achieve a score of at least 600 on the TOEFL to   be considered for a teaching assistantship. In the case of a new international   student, previous teaching experience will increase the likelihood of a teaching   assistantship being awarded. Other types of assistantships include research   assistantships, which are arranged directly with members of the faculty who have   research funding, and graduate service assistantships, which may involve   computer-related work with other faculty or organizations on campus. In both   cases, the chances of a student's being awarded such an assistantship may be   greater after the student has been at NDSU for one or two semesters. The   Graduate School does not allow tuition waivers without an assistantship. </p>            <p>International students are required by the North Dakota State Board of Higher   Education to have medical insurance. Proof of valid coverage must be provided to   the Office of International Programs before an international student is allowed   to register. The requirement for insurance applies to the student, the student's   spouse, and any other dependents accompanying the student. In addition, the   Board requires as a condition of enrollment that all students demonstrate that   they are immune from measles and rubella. </p>            <p>Students who have earned graduate credits from an international institution   (other than U.S. or Canadian) will not receive transfer credit for those   courses. They may earn credit in a similar course at NDSU through examination. </p>            <p><A name="ID"></a><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scholarship Standards</strong> </p>            <p>In fulfilling graduate course requirements on any plan of study, only grades   of "A", "B", or "C" are acceptable. All courses for which grades are given will   be used in calculating the grade point average, unless a course has been   repeated. In this case, both grades will appear on the transcript, but only the   most recent grade will be used in calculation of the grade point average. (A   specific course can be retaken only once and only a total of three courses may   be retaken). To be in good standing and to receive a graduate degree, a student   must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or "B". </p>            <p>The Department and/or advisory committee may require a higher performance   than "C" in certain courses. While some courses may be used for graduate credit   with a grade of "C", acquisition of more than two (2) grades of "C" or less may   be grounds for dismissal upon recommendation by the department/program chair. </p>            <p>A student who fails to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least   3.0 after the first two semesters of attendance will be placed on academic <strong><U>probation</U></strong>. He/she may not continue the pursuit of a graduate   degree without special permission from the Dean of The Graduate School acting on   the recommendation of the Computer Science Department. This recommendation must   include a review of the student's status and a program of remediation that will   afford the student the opportunity to return to a 3.0 cumulative grade point   average within two additional semesters. If the cumulative grade point average   is not 3.0 or better after two additional semesters, the student will be <strong><U>dismissed</U></strong> from the Graduate School. Students on academic probation   are not eligible for graduate assistantships or tuition waivers. </p>            <p><A name="IE"></a><strong>E. Preparing for the Masters Program</strong> </p>            <p>Once you have been accepted for the M.S. degree program in Computer Science   at NDSU, you should plan to arrive on campus about one week before the start of   classes. A letter to the Department prior to your arrival is not necessary   unless you wish an assistantship. You should come to the department and learn   who will be your initial advisor. You should also learn where your mailbox and   perhaps your office will be, and whether or not there will be any meetings that   you should attend. </p>            <p>If you wish to be considered for an assistantship, you must write to the   Department Chair as soon as possible. Assistantships are usually awarded on a   yearly basis in April preceding the fall start of the academic year. Only a very   limited number of assistantships are available after that date. The Graduate   School does not allow tuition waivers without an assistantship. </p>            <p>When you arrive for the start of your courses, you should be comfortable with   programming in at least one high level language (preferably Java or C++), and   with elementary data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. Many of our   graduate courses use the UNIX operating system. <BR />              &nbsp;</p>          </blockquote>          <A name="II"></a><strong>II. Description of Master's Program</strong>          <blockquote>Summary of Procedures for the Master's Degree            <p>1. Gain admission to the Graduate School. </p>            <p>2. If appropriate, remove admission deficiencies in order to qualify for   full- standing status (within the first year of study). </p>            <p>3. Select, with the major advisor, one or more department faculty members to   serve on the supervisory committee. Remember, the third committee member is the   Graduate School Appointee. The supervisory committee should be selected by the   end of the student's third semester at NDSU. </p>            <p>4. Develop a plan of study with the major advisor in consultation with the   supervisory committee (usually 3rd semester of attendance). </p>            <p>5. Submit the Plan of Study to the graduate dean for approval. </p>            <p>6. Complete courses listed on plan of study, including the disquisition. </p>            <p>7. Personally meet with the registrar to verify that all courses on the plan   of study have been completed and the required GPA has been attained. </p>            <p>8. Seek permission to schedule the oral examination from the major advisor.   Remember, the request to schedule the examination is sent by the major advisor   to the Graduate School two weeks prior to the examination. </p>            <p>9. Submit the disquisition in near final form to the committee members no   less than seven days prior to the examination. </p>            <p>10.

The student will eventually (usually by the end of the second   semester) select a thesis or comprehensive study advisor, as described in the   Graduate Bulletin. We call this faculty member the research advisor. Generally   this person would be someone from whom you have taken at least one course and   whose research interests include an area in which you are interested. If this   faculty member agrees to be your advisor, then in consultation with him or her   you will select the other members of your graduate committee. See below (C and   D) for more information regarding selecting the committee and filing a Plan of   Study. </p>            <p><A name="IIB"></a><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer of Credit</strong> </p>            <p>All graduate credits used to meet the requirements of a master's degree must   be approved by the supervisory/advisory committee, the department/program chair,   the academic dean, and the dean of the Graduate School. A maximum of nine   semester hours of graduate credit with grades of "A" or "B" earned at another   university may be transferred provided that institution is accredited to offer   graduate courses. It is the responsibility of the student to provide official   transcripts of graduate courses taken elsewhere to the Graduate School. Graduate   credits earned through the Tri-College University are considered resident   credits. </p>            <p><A name="IIC"></a><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan of Study</strong> </p>            <p>The Plan of Study lists all the courses a student has taken and intends to   take to satisfy the requirements for the M.S. degree. The names of the student's   advisory committee are identified on this form as well. Any courses the student   wishes to transfer to NDSU from another institution must be indicated on the   Plan. </p>            <p>The Plan of Study shall be appropriate to meet the interests and needs of the   student in his/her chosen field as determined by the supervisory committee and   approved by the department/program chair, the academic dean, and the dean of the   Graduate School. The master's Plan of Study must be filed in the Graduate School   at least one semester prior to graduation. It shall include the specific courses   the student is expected to complete and all other requirements of the particular   master's degree that the student is seeking. Computer Science requires a minimum   of 32 semester credits including two credits of seminar (CS 790). Operations   Research requires 32 semester credits including two credits of graduate seminar   (CS 790). At least two, and no more then nine, of the credits may be in CS 797   or 798. Computer Science permits a maximum of nine hours of independent study.   All 600 and 700 level Computer Science courses may be used, except in cases   where the department has determined that there is too much overlap between a   600-level course and a 700-level course in the same area. In such a case,   students should take the 700-level course. </p>            <p>The Plan of Study may be revised as advisable and necessary.

The Proposal contains (i) a description of the proposed work and (ii)   a justification of why the work is suitable for a Thesis Paper or Comprehensive   Study project. At least one semester before the final oral exam, all committee   members must certify that the proposed work would be suitable for a Thesis or   Comprehensive Study paper if carried out as described.                <p>1.2&nbsp; The final document should declare at the outset what sort of paper it   is: an expository paper, a program, a new algorithm, a comparative study, etc.,   so that it can legitimately involve an application, experiment, program, survey   or theoretical contribution. No attempt is made to restrict topics. </p>                <p>1.3&nbsp; Techniques used in the work must reflect maturity and professionalism   associated with Master's level expertise. </p>                <blockquote>1.3.1 All programs must reflect the principles of good style and   documentation as currently espoused by the department.                  <p>1.3.2 All programs must be fully tested, with results reported in the text of   the paper. An application programming project should include evidence that the   intended capability has been provided to the end user. In such cases, it is   desirable to have testing by end users and to provide a User's Manual. </p>                  <p>1.3.3 A conversational system must have well designed dialogue and menus, and   response times appropriate to the tasks. <BR />                    &nbsp;</p>                </blockquote>                1.4&nbsp; The context   and scope of the work must be clearly explained and referenced. Depending on the   topic, this may include references to the literature in Computer Science,   Operations Research and/or an application area. Any significant paper of the   preceding five years which has appeared in the accessible literature must be   referenced.                <p>1.5&nbsp; The document must be an example of quality scientific writing in the   English language. </p>                <p>1.6&nbsp; The paper must include substantial analysis.

In some rare cases, at the discretion of a faculty   member, independent study credits can be granted for carrying out work which   develops expertise needed to begin a Comprehensive Study project (not more than   three credits total). The work carried out should demonstrate the ability to do   scholarly study appropriate to the major field. A mature and professional   completion of the project could reasonably be expected of a person with a   Master's degree, but not of a person who holds a bachelor's degree and has no   experience. </p>              <p><A name="IIG3"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Thesis Option</U> </p>              <p>The intent of the thesis option is to provide a research-oriented degree, for   those who wish to pursue a particular topic in depth. The thesis earns between   six and ten credits. The number of credits is normally determined in   consultation with the advisor, but issues concerning the number of credits   granted can be brought to the student's committee for judgment. A thesis should   demonstrate the ability to do research in the major field.

During the 1996-97 academic year, more than 40 graduate students were   offered assistantships. </p>            <p>Teaching assistantships, awarded by the department, usually involve teaching   one or two sections of undergraduate service courses. A few teaching   assistantships involve paper-grading and/or tutoring. Research assistantships,   which are arranged directly with faculty who have research funding, involve   assisting faculty with their research. Service assistantships involve   computer-science-related work, sometimes for other faculty or organizations on   campus. During the 2002-2003 academic year, the normal stipend for a student who   has a half-time teaching assistantship (see below) and is teaching one section   of a service course is $456 per month. Stipends in other cases may vary   slightly. </p>            <p>A full-time assistantship requires 20 hours of work per week, and a half-time   assistantship 10 hours. An assistantship involving at least 10 hours per week   qualifies the student for a waiver of all tuition and fees. The Department is   not able to offer a waiver of tuition or fees to students who are not awarded   assistantships. However, there is a scholarship program administered by the Dean   of the Graduate School that offers some of these. Students should contact the   Graduate School office for applications. </p>            <p>Decisions concerning financial aid are normally made by April 15 for the   following academic year. This means that for persons applying for financial aid,   it is important to get the applications in well before that date. </p>            <p>An application for financial aid requires a separate letter of application   sent to the department, in addition to checking the box on the standard   application form. A foreign applicant who is not a native English speaker may   have an initial disadvantage with regard to the awarding of assistantships,   simply because a foreign application is often more difficult to evaluate with   regard to the applicant's proficiency in spoken English. </p>            <p>In addition, the following rules have been approved by NDSU regarding   applicants who are not native speakers of English and who have not previously   held assistantships. If the applicant's score on the TOEFL examination is lower   than 525, he/she is not accepted initially as a regular graduate student, and no   assistantship can be awarded. If the TOEFL score in between 525 and 600, before   receiving an assistantship the applicant must take a summer course on English As   A Second Language (offered by the Department of Modern Languages) and must have   a personal interview conducted by a committee which contains both a member of   the department granting the assistantship and a member of the faculty   specializing in English As A Second Language. If the TOEFL score is over 600,   the summer course is not required but the interview is still necessary. Note   that the Computer Science Department normally requires a minimum TOEFL score of   550 for admission; see I, C. </p>            <p><A name="VIIB"></a><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention of Assistantships</strong> </p>            <p>The selection of a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) is based on an   assessment of the individual's academic potential and potential as an   instructor. The continuation of the assistantship will be determined by success   in the courses in which the GTA is enrolled and by demonstration of satisfactory   performance of instructional duties. </p>            <p>To retain the assistantship, an individual must be in good standing with the   graduate school. That means maintaining a grade point average (GPA) of at least   3.0 in your courses that count for graduate study. The transition from   undergraduate to graduate studies is sometimes difficult. In recognition of this   fact, GTA's who fail to make at least a 3.0 GPA their first semester but earn a   GPA of at least 2.6 will be placed on probation. That means retention of the GTA   position depends on earning at least a 3.0 GPA in the second semester. GTA's who   are not in good standing with the graduate school at the end of the two   semesters of graduate work will not have their assistantship renewed. Once good   standing is attained the students may reapply for an assistantship. GTA's whose   cumulative GPA falls below 3.0 at any time other than the first semester of   graduate school will lose the assistantship. </p>            <p>As a classroom instructor, a GTA represents NDSU in general and the Computer   Science Department in particular. Hence the position requires satisfactory   performance of duties. Each semester each GTA will be evaluated by a faculty   supervisor. A copy of this written report will be given to the GTA and the   department chair. If the performance is judged unsatisfactory, a written warning   will be issued. This means the GTA is on probation. If the performance does not   significantly improve, the assistantship will be terminated at the end of the   semester the warning was issued. This termination may be appealed in writing to   the chair of the Computer Science Department. The appellant may then be granted   a hearing with the chair, the director of Graduate Studies and the faculty   supervisor. The final decision rests with the chair. <BR />              &nbsp;</p>          </blockquote>          <A name="VIII"></a><strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helpful offices and phone numbers</strong>          <blockquote>Computer Science Department&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IACC Bldg., room 258 <BR />            CS   Administrative Secretary,&nbsp; 231-8562 <BR />            CS Administrative Assistant,   231-6513<BR />            Ken Nygard, Graduate Coordinator,&nbsp; 231-8203 <BR />            Information   Technology Services&nbsp; (IACC 206),&nbsp; 231-7961 <BR />            Graduate School Office&nbsp; (Admin.   202),&nbsp; 231-7033 <BR />            Foreign Student Advisor&nbsp; (Ceres 118),&nbsp; 231-7895 <BR />            Housing   Office:  <blockquote>Married Student Housing,&nbsp; 231-8446 <BR />    Assistant Director's Office,&nbsp;   231-8446 <BR />    University Village Services and Repairs,&nbsp;   231-7700</blockquote>            Library,&nbsp; 231-8876 <BR />            Interlibrary Loan,&nbsp;   231-8885</blockquote>          <p></p><strong><em><br />				          <p><A name="III"></a><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description of Ph.D. Program in Computer   Science</strong> </p>          <blockquote>Summary of Procedures for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree:            <p>1.&nbsp; Gain admission to the Graduate School. </p>            <p>2.&nbsp; Select a research advisor willing to supervise the student's work on a   project leading to a dissertation.

The program   requires that a student have a bachelor's degree or a master's degree in   computer science.&nbsp; In some cases, students with a degree in a closely related   area may be considered. </p>            <p>Admission to the program is competitive, and requirements for admission to   this program are more rigorous than for admission to the M.S. program.&nbsp; In order   to be considered seriously, an applicant must normally have the equivalent of at   least a 3.25 gpa (on a 4-point scale).&nbsp; A high grade-point average alone does   not guarantee admission; the admissions committee will look at the applicant's   overall academic record, as well as any relevant employment and professional   experience.&nbsp; Of particular importance is evidence of the applicant's potential   for scholarship and independent research at the Ph.D. level.&nbsp; Letters of   recommendation that can provide such evidence will be helpful. </p>            <p><A name="IIIB"></a><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Information</strong> </p>            <p>A beginning student is assigned an initial academic advisor when he/she   enters the program. Normally by the end of the third semester, the student will   have made arrangements with the faculty member who will serve as the   dissertation advisor. The faculty member is to be a person on the current list   of qualified Ph.D. advisors which is available from the Department Secretary.   Approximately the same time, the student, in consultation with the advisor, will   arrange for the formation of the advisory committee; see section C. below for   more information. </p>            <p><A name="IIIC"></a><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advisory Committee</strong> </p>            <p>For each prospective candidate for the doctoral degree, an advisory committee   consisting of at least five members of the graduate faculty will be appointed.   The student, with the approval of the department/program chair, will select a   major advisor. The relationship between student and major advisor must be a   mutually acceptable one. The major advisor will act as the chair of the   student's advisory committee and will be in charge of the plan of study. The   major advisor and student will agree upon three additional committee members. A   fourth committee member will serve as the appointee of the Graduate School. One   committee member must be from outside the student's academic college. Additional   committee members having expertise in the educational area may also be   appointed. These additional members may not necessarily be NDSU graduate   faculty. The advisory committee agreed upon by the major advisor and student,   and approved by the department/program chair and the academic dean, will be   recommended to the dean of the Graduate School for approval and formal   appointment. Each committee member will have an equal vote in committee   decisions. The committee is to assist the student in the preparation of a   program of study and to advise him/her during the period of graduate work. Thus,   the advisory committee should meet with the student periodically to review   progress of graduate work. </p>            <p><A name="IIID"></a><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan of Study</strong> </p>            <p>The plan of study will be prepared by the student and the major advisor and   shall be approved by the advisory committee, department/program chair, academic   dean, and dean of the Graduate School.

During the 1996-97 academic year, more than 40 graduate students were   offered assistantships. </p>                <p>Teaching assistantships, awarded by the department, usually involve teaching   one or two sections of undergraduate service courses. A few teaching   assistantships involve paper-grading and/or tutoring. Research assistantships,   which are arranged directly with faculty who have research funding, involve   assisting faculty with their research. Service assistantships involve   computer-science-related work, sometimes for other faculty or organizations on   campus. During the 2002-2003 academic year, the normal stipend for a student who   has a half-time teaching assistantship (see below) and is teaching one section   of a service course is $456 per month. Stipends in other cases may vary   slightly. </p>                <p>A full-time assistantship requires 20 hours of work per week, and a half-time   assistantship 10 hours. An assistantship involving at least 10 hours per week   qualifies the student for a waiver of all tuition and fees. The Department is   not able to offer a waiver of tuition or fees to students who are not awarded   assistantships. However, there is a scholarship program administered by the Dean   of the Graduate School that offers some of these. Students should contact the   Graduate School office for applications. </p>                <p>Decisions concerning financial aid are normally made by April 15 for the   following academic year. This means that for persons applying for financial aid,   it is important to get the applications in well before that date. </p>                <p>An application for financial aid requires a separate letter of application   sent to the department, in addition to checking the box on the standard   application form. A foreign applicant who is not a native English speaker may   have an initial disadvantage with regard to the awarding of assistantships,   simply because a foreign application is often more difficult to evaluate with   regard to the applicant's proficiency in spoken English. </p>                <p>In addition, the following rules have been approved by NDSU regarding   applicants who are not native speakers of English and who have not previously   held assistantships. If the applicant's score on the TOEFL examination is lower   than 525, he/she is not accepted initially as a regular graduate student, and no   assistantship can be awarded. If the TOEFL score in between 525 and 600, before   receiving an assistantship the applicant must take a summer course on English As   A Second Language (offered by the Department of Modern Languages) and must have   a personal interview conducted by a committee which contains both a member of   the department granting the assistantship and a member of the faculty   specializing in English As A Second Language. If the TOEFL score is over 600,   the summer course is not required but the interview is still necessary. Note   that the Computer Science Department normally requires a minimum TOEFL score of   550 for admission; see I, C. </p>                <p><A name="VIIB"></a><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention of Assistantships</strong> </p>                <p>The selection of a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) is based on an   assessment of the individual's academic potential and potential as an   instructor. The continuation of the assistantship will be determined by success   in the courses in which the GTA is enrolled and by demonstration of satisfactory   performance of instructional duties. </p>                <p>To retain the assistantship, an individual must be in good standing with the   graduate school. That means maintaining a grade point average (GPA) of at least   3.0 in your courses that count for graduate study. The transition from   undergraduate to graduate studies is sometimes difficult. In recognition of this   fact, GTA's who fail to make at least a 3.0 GPA their first semester but earn a   GPA of at least 2.6 will be placed on probation. That means retention of the GTA   position depends on earning at least a 3.0 GPA in the second semester. GTA's who   are not in good standing with the graduate school at the end of the two   semesters of graduate work will not have their assistantship renewed. Once good   standing is attained the students may reapply for an assistantship. GTA's whose   cumulative GPA falls below 3.0 at any time other than the first semester of   graduate school will lose the assistantship. </p>                <p>As a classroom instructor, a GTA represents NDSU in general and the Computer   Science Department in particular. Hence the position requires satisfactory   performance of duties. Each semester each GTA will be evaluated by a faculty   supervisor. A copy of this written report will be given to the GTA and the   department chair. If the performance is judged unsatisfactory, a written warning   will be issued. This means the GTA is on probation. If the performance does not   significantly improve, the assistantship will be terminated at the end of the   semester the warning was issued. This termination may be appealed in writing to   the chair of the Computer Science Department. The appellant may then be granted   a hearing with the chair, the director of Graduate Studies and the faculty   supervisor. The final decision rests with the chair.                   &nbsp;</p>              </blockquote>            <A name="VIII"></a><strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helpful offices and phone numbers</strong>              <blockquote>Computer Science Department&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IACC Bldg., room 258                <p>CS Administrative Secretary,&nbsp; 231-8562 <BR />                  CS Administrative Assistant,   231-6513<BR />                  Ken Nygard, Graduate Coordinator,&nbsp; 231-8203 <BR />                  Information   Technology Services&nbsp; (IACC 206),&nbsp; 231-7961 <BR />                  Graduate School Office&nbsp; (Admin.   202),&nbsp; 231-7033 <BR />                  Foreign Student Advisor&nbsp; (Ceres 118),&nbsp; 231-7895 <BR />                  Housing   Office: </p>                <blockquote>Married Student Housing,&nbsp; 231-8446 <BR />                  Assistant Director's Office,&nbsp;   231-8446 <BR />                  University Village Services and Repairs,&nbsp;   231-7700</blockquote>                Library,&nbsp; 231-8876 <BR />                Interlibrary Loan,&nbsp;   231-8885<br />                <br />		</blockquote></blockquote></em></strong></td></table>				             Kendall E.
