The first courses were offered in the Division of Mathematical  Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (now the  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering). A Bachelor of Science  degree in Computer Science first was offered in 1977, the Master of Science  degree in Computer Science was added in 1979 and the Ph.D. program in Computer  Science began in 1986. The Department began the Management Information Systems  (MIS) program in 1988. Graduate programs in Software Engineering were launched  in 2002, including; Certificate, Master of Science, and Ph.D. curriculums. A  graduate certificate in Electronic Commerce first was first offered in 2002.  Most recently, in 2009, an online &lsquo;distance education&rsquo; professional Master&rsquo;s  degree program was initiated.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division of Mathematical Sciences split into three  departments: Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science / Operations  Research in 1988. Kenneth Magel served as the Department Chair for the first  eight years. Then, in 1996, Kendall Nygard took the helm for nine years.&nbsp; In 2005, Kenneth Magel once again accepted  the Chair position until the leadership structure changed to a Department Head  system. (The main difference between a Chair and a Head is that the Head is  appointed by the upper administration rather than elected by the faculty.)&nbsp; On July 1, 2007, Brian M. Slator became the  first Head of the Department.<br>          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the Department had; five full professors, three  associate professors, seven assistant professors, a senior lecturer, an  advisor/lecturer, and three lecturers. There were 33 Doctoral students, 163  Master's students, and 272 Computer Science Majors. <br>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff consists of; the administrative assistant - Carole  Huber, the full time secretary - Stephanie Sculthorp, the part time secretary -  Betty Opheim, and the department systems administrator - Adam Helsene.<br>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department occupies 7,460 square feet of space on the  first and second floors of the Industrial Agriculture and Communications Center  building which was built in 1992.        <BR /></p>      </div></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td class="Column1" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>    <td valign="top" class="Column2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table><div id="footerlinks" align="center">	   <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/">NDSU Home &nbsp;&nbsp;  </a>  |  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/phonebook">NDSU Phonebook </a> &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=IACCMap.pdf>IACC Map &nbsp;&nbsp;  </a>  |  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/ndsu/maps/2006.CampusMap.pdf">Campus Map</a> | &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href ="http://www.cityoffargo.com">City of Fargo</a>	   </div>    <!--Begin Footer --><div class="footer" align="center">Updated on   <!-- #BeginDate format:Am1 -->June 13, 2011<!-- #EndDate --> &nbsp;&nbsp;I &nbsp;&nbsp;Email: <a href="mailto:webmaster@cs.ndsu.edu">Webmaster</a></div> <div class="footer" align="center"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target="_blank">Please download the latest version of Adobe Reader :: Free Download</a></div><div class="footer" align="center">This site is best viewed in Internet Explorer 6.0 or Netscape 7.0 </div> <!--End Footer --></body></html><!-- #BeginDate format:Am1 -->June 13, 2011<!-- #EndDate -->
